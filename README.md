# Project-IT-Academy
This is a java project that I've made for the IT Academy Noord Nederland. It is a webapplication that shows the main features of a ski town. I've used Spring Boot for the backend of the application and Angular for the frontend. It is configered with a MySQL database. Other technologies that I have used are: Apach Maven, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JSON.
